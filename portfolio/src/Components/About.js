            Hello! I'm a passionate **Data Analyst Apprentice** and **Full-Stack Web Developer** with a drive for turning complex data into actionable insights and building dynamic, user-friendly applications. My journey in tech is fueled by a love for problem-solving, whether it's optimizing a database or crafting a seamless user interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I'm a dedicated **language enthusiast**, always seeking to understand new cultures through their words. This same curiosity and attention to detail also fuels my passion for football. As a proud fan of both **FC Barcelona** and **Manchester City**, I've learned the importance of teamwork, strategy, and continuous improvementâ€”principles I apply to every project I undertake.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm always eager to learn and grow, bringing a blend of technical expertise and a unique perspective to every challenge.
